# goodreads-scraper
For the introduction, I actually have tried scraping book data from FictionDB.com before for my own-build thesis dataset but the cover images quality is mainly poor. So I re-scraping the book data from ISBN number that I got from the previous attempt in FictionDB before and search it automatically in Goodreads.com for my training dataset.

For my testing dataset, I scrape it from Goodreads' Best Book of The Year page in here: https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/114787.Best_Books_2019

I'm still a newbie in data mining field and this is my first time publish my scraper code in github. Scraping a website turns out to be a great experience and I enjoy it.
If you have any suggestion about this code, you can pull a request or contribute to my repository. And please kindly give your feedback if you found this code helpful for you ^^
